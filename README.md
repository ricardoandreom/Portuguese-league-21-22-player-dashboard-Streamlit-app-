# Portuguese league 21-22 - Player dashboard - Streamlit-app

Simple player dashboard with **Streamlit** and **Python**. 

For each **Liga Bwin 2021/22** player, it can show: **Team, Age, Role, Appearances, Goals/90, xG/90, Assists/90, xA/90** and **xT/90**.

Be careful with the path files to run the app.  

To install streamlit on your console:  **pip install streamlit**  

To run the app write on your console:  **streamlit run (app_name).py**
